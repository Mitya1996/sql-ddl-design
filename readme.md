## Part 2

After some thought, considering the little data that there is I feel like one table is sufficient for all 3 of these.
___
### Air Traffic

If air_traffic db is to be expanded, a table of airports can be made (longitude, latitude, class_airspace, ect.), a table of runways (many to one airport, with colums such as heading, surface), a table of aircraft (tail_number, make, model, if it is commercial/general aviation, ect. )

A table of pilots 
___
### Music 

Producers and artists would have their own tables, if this is to made into a 'global' database
___
### Outer Space
This database probably wouldn't make sense to try to make 'global' because there is just too much info. However, a table of stars, galaxies would be the next logical step
